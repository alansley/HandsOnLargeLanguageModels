### Why?
You learn more if you work out the code & mess with it rather than relying on other people's code - so this matches up w/ what the book does, but it also contains some other little bits and pieces of experimentation and nicities like caching any data files we need rather than re-downloading them each run.  

Also, there's a ton of notes & comments alongside the code to help me (and you?) understand exactly what the hell's going on! 

Many thanks to Jay Alammar & Maarten Grootendorst for their terrific book =D
